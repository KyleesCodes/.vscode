    <h2>Kylee</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Kylee, I am 22 years old and I am currently a data entry clerk while I study to become a software engineer. I am a freshman at BYU-I right now pursuing a Bachelor's of Applied Technology.</p>
    <p>I am excited for this semester since I will finally start to learn CSS. Last year I participated in a self taught course on HTML that gave me my first certificate in programming. Through that program, I found my desire to learn how to program and chose my major in Applied Technology.</p>
    <p>The last thing I would like to share is that I have been a member for 16 years. My family converted when I was around 4 years old. Since then I was raised in the church and I had fallen away for 2 years, starting shortly before the 2020 pandemic. After a lot of soul searching, I came back to church the week before my 21st birthday and have been attending as much as possible since.</p>
    <p>Thank you for reading and I am excited to meet you all!</p>
